Knight's Tour:

This program implements a greedy algorithm to solve the Knights Tour problem on a 8x8 chessboard
The greedy algorithm: 
- Starts from a given position (0.0)
- Marks the square as "visited"
- Tries all 8 different moves the knight can do (in order)
- Chooses the first valid move
- Repeats until no more moves are available

Furthermore the program calculates how many moves are possible from each square using the greedy algorithm and displays the amount of possible moves from each position in a 8x8 grid
